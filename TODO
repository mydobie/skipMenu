- Set so button can be hidden when click outside
- Rebuild automatically on file change
- Get landmarks
- Get "other" elements (should be passed as elements then use text and/or aria-label, aria-labled-by)
- Clear menu when \_buildMenu is called

- Figure out why it is slow slow to add proper events to the correct elements - when the page loads you cannot use the menu to go to the headings right away

- Break down methods into more sub methods
