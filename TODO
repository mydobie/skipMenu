- Set so button can be hidden when click outside

- Get "other" elements (should be passed as elements then use text and/or aria-label, aria-labled-by)

- Figure out why it is slow slow to add proper events to the correct elements - when the page loads you cannot use the menu to go to the headings right away

  - Do calculations to determine if menu should be updated

- Remove menu entirely (not sure why this is needed)
